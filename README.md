# gpsd-lisp
A Common Lisp client for reading GPSD data.

GPSD is a daemon that sits between a physical GPS (or GLONASS)
receiver and your software. It standardizes the format of GPS data so
that no matter which proprietary (or semi-broken) standard your GPS
receiver uses, you get a consistent usable output. It also allows
multiple devices to share a single receiver, which is non-trivial when
dealing with serial devices. This library brings the wonders of
satellite navigation to your Common Lisp code. GPSD is available from
(and documented at) http://catb.org/gpsd

The basic mode of operation of this library is to load the library,
then kick off a thread that continuously monitors the GPSD daemon over
a TCP connection, updating your location whenever new data is
available.  The default is to connect to a GPSD running locally (ie,
127.0.0.1) on TCP port 2947.  If this does not match your setup, you
will need to supply the appropriate parameters. Most people running
GPSD simply run it on their local machine and bind only to localhost,
or '127.0.0.1'.  To load the daemon and start the polling thread, do
the following:

```
CL-USER> (ql:quickload :gpsd)
To load "gpsd":
  Load 1 ASDF system:
    gpsd
; Loading "gpsd"
.........
(:GPSD)
CL-USER> (gpsd:start-gpsd "127.0.0.1" 2947)
gpsd update thread is running...
NIL
CL-USER>
```

The officially supported method for getting your current location is
to call (get-current-location), which returns an object containing
your location (as well as a great deal of other data). If the GPSD
thread has not yet been started (start-gpsd), this function returns
nil. If the thread has stopped, died, or crashed, it also returns
nil. It's your responsibility to use the timestamp to ensure that the
data you're receiving is current. If the GPSD daemon dies, this
library continues to return the last known location, along with the
timestamp of that last known location. The slowest GPS receiver I've
seen in 10+ years reports at 0.5hz, so it's probably safe to assume
that any timestamp more than five seconds old (being extremely
conservative here) is probably invalid. There's a handy convenience
function called (pp) that displays much of this data returned by the
GPS nicely (though keep in mind that more data is available by
accessing fields in the object directly):

```
CL-USER> (gpsd:pp (gpsd:get-current-location))
Time:  2016-09-07T13:24:18.000000-07:00
Lat:  41.237125
Lon:  -111.53106
Alt:  23.5
Spd:  0.306
Crs:  128.7265
Sats:  5
Mode:  3
Datum:  WGS84
NIL
CL-USER>
```

The fields in the object are:

* point-lat
* point-lon
* point-alt
* point-spd
* point-crs
* point-sats
* point-mode
* creation-time

Example:

```
CL-USER> (list (gpsd:point-lat (gpsd:get-current-location)) (gpsd:point-lon (gpsd:get-current-location)))
(41.237125 -111.53106)
CL-USER>
```

Most of these fields are self-explanatory. point-sats gives the number
of satellites that were part of the current fix (more is better) and
point-mode refers to the mode the receiver is in (documented on the
GPSD web site). The short version is that a value of '2' means the
receiver is in 2D mode (no valid altitude) and '3' indicates 3D mode
(altitude is valid). creation-time is a unix time_t timestamp.

GPSD reports all values in metric. Speed is reported in meters/second
and altitude is in meters. There are convenience macros in the GPSD
library for converting to other units:

* m-to-ft
* ms-to-fs
* ms-to-fm
* ms-to-kph
* ms-to-kts
* ms-to-mph

Example (first example is altitude in meters, second is in feet):

```
CL-USER> (gpsd:point-alt (gpsd:get-current-location))
139.716
CL-USER> (gpsd:m-to-ft (gpsd:point-alt (gpsd:get-current-location)))
467.14236
CL-USER>
```

There is also a function to convert a decimal heading to a cardinal heading:

```
CL-USER> (gpsd:deg-to-cardinal-course (gpsd:point-crs (gpsd:get-current-location)))
"East"
CL-USER>
```

This library utilizes the location objects from aviation-formulary-lisp, which means it's also compatible with the various functions available in that library (distance between points, bearing between points, etc).
